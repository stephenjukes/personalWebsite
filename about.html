                                <span>Teaching</span>
                                <p> Teaching any subject requires the ability to simplify anything of  potential complexity. When teaching English to non native speakers, this requires strategies ranging from the obvious, (eg. body language) to the more subtle (priming and asking strategic questions). When teaching IT, this requires the use of metaphors, which transform abstract and invisible concepts into familiar concepts that people feel comfortable with. In the web development industry, <strong>clarity in communication is important. It ensures that the team works effectively as a whole, and that the client’s needs are met.</strong>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="roleClosed">
                                <span>Training</span>
                                <p> Training adults proves to be little different to teaching children – <strong>both have limited attention spans, both feel motivated by positive feedback,  and both require a lot of review and practice in order to achieve mastery. </strong>I believe that if I was ever in a position to guide newer developers, I would be able to draw out their full potential.
                                </p>
                            </li>
							<li class="roleClosed">
                                <span>Curriculum Development</span>
                                <p> Curriculum development can be an enormous task, and first requires the developer to stand back from the project and consider the overall objectives, before deciding on how to achieve them, and in turn focusing on the details. In the same way with web development, <strong>identifying the overall objectives and making a broad plan</strong> can help the developer accomplish a product that <strong>fulfills exactly what is needed in the most direct and efficient way. </strong>
                                </p>
                            </li>
							<li class="roleClosed">
                                <span>Event Organization and Management</span>
                                <p>Event organization is similar to curriculum development insomuch as considering overall objectives and constructing a broad plan, however the effects of neglecting detail is far more obvious in this case. When arranging a cooking activity – how will groups be divided? What ingredients and equipment is needed? If groups need to share equipment, how can the activity be organised so that no one is doing nothing for too long?  How can you ensure that students are safe when using knives and stoves? In the same way, web development requires the same level of foresight.<strong> In testing, what are the edge cases? What kind of unexpected behaviour might your user adopt? What design would help the user to navigate your site easiest.</strong> Besides the obvious issue of perfect syntax, these are all details which determine the success of a project.
                                </p>
                            </li>
							<li class="roleClosed">
                                <span>Intermediating and Problem Solving</span>
                                <p>Inevitably, there would be problems. Teachers would become frustrated by cultural differences, or conflicts would arise, and it would sometimes be necessary for me to deal with these issues. Like teaching, communication is key, but while teaching focuses on imparting information, intermediating focuses more on putting the other party/ies at ease, and if possible trying to find a mutually benefitial solution. <strong>Communication of this kind requires listening, (a lot of listening) and the ability to keep calm while other parties may not be.</strong> In general, this calls for composure and respect for the other party. Similarly, where web developers must work with clients and together as a team, these communication skills are fundamental for the smooth running of a project.
                                </p>
